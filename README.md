# Easy-Double-Column-Posts
A simple tool to help the content creators in Hive that make posts with two columns.

The website (https://amaillo.github.io/Easy-Double-Column-Posts/) is divided in 3 areas, the most upper one is to add a title (optional), save the current text or import it from an old session. The middle area is where the body of the text goes, also you can add more segments and a unique centered column if you need to put a center image or message to separate one text segment from another. The final area has the ouput text, this one must be copied to the clipboard using the respective button, then the text can be pasted in the place where you are going to publish it.
